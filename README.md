# 💖 Waifu Module
✏️ This is just a fun side project I made for learning purposes I don't know if I'm gonna continue working on this project again but if I do then I'll make sure to update the code here.

⚠️ Also credit where credit is due this is not made by me a friend of mine made it, I am just reusing his code trying to make something better, I will make sure to link his socials when I do find it.

🛡️ I got full rights from him to modify the codebase however I like so I will be doing just that, I will use this as a starter template to build something more out of it, That being said the starter version is gonna be the raw code that he provided me.
## ⁉️ How to use?


To use this module first you're gonna have to download all the necessary requirements.
